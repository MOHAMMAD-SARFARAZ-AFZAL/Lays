Hi there, I am Mohammad Sarfaraz Afzal.
This frontend project is for a frontend hackathon made by me and my teammates Md Adil Farhan and Nahid Azad.
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, and JavaScript are used to develop this project from scratch.
We learned many new things regarding not only web designing and development but also teamwork and communication throughout the journey of developing this project.
